### vim-Twilight

After a years long search for the Twilight TextMate theme for vim,
I finally found [coloration](https://github.com/sickill/coloration).

I was quickly bummed out by the disappearance of the online converter,
but heartened to find that the Ruby gem was still available.  This is 
the beautiful Twilight theme converted, fairly accurately, to a vim theme.

Enjoy.
